# Simple-Registration-and-Chat-Application
This project is done using PHP, Mysql, Javascript and Ajax.

## Basic Setup
Download the repository and change the folder name 'Simple-Registration-and-Chat-Application-master' to 'mounty'. Copy the folder and paste it into your XAMP's htdocs OR WAMP's www folder. Changing the folder name to 'mounty' is important. Otherwise routing and other php script will not work.

## Database
Open the 'mounty' folder and navigate to 'Database' folder. Copy the 'mounty_db.sql' file and import it to your database server by creating a database named mounty_db. If you want to change the database name then you have to change it in the connection.php accordingly.
